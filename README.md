# Techdegree-Project-4

This is my third Treehouse Techdegree Project

## About this project

In this project I created the Movie Hunter game using Object Orintated JavaScript

## Style Changes made

I added my own color scheme to the game rather than the provided color scheme. This included changing the correct and incorrect chosen characters to green and red as appose to orange and blue. I also change the overlays at the end of the game to match this color scheme. I did this by updating the CSS variables and using them in more places.
